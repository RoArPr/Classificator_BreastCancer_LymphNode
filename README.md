# Classificator_BreastCancer_LymphNode
Classificator of tumours respect to the lymph node-code

## Description
This work is a modified part of my capstone project 'Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree' at Udacity (Dec, 2017).
I applied a Logistic Regression model to classify tumours respect to the lymph node-code (0: negative, 1:positive),
using a subset of selected data (27 proteins).
A heatmap of proteins with significant differences (p<=0.01) is shown.
Original paper:'Proteogenomics connects somatic mutations to signalling in breast cancerâ€™. Philipp Mertins and co.Nature. 2016.
The dataset is also posted in Kaggle.

The project is written in Python and can be run using Anaconda notebook **'classificator_lymphnode.ipynb'** . 

#### Following files contain the data:
'data_lymph.csv': normalized protein levels of these subset of data
